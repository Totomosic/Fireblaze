Fireblaze
MMORPG

Events that happen in the game have a lasting impact, eg. Monsters invading a city/town make it unusable until reclaimed
    => May need to be able to start up own server (new game instance) to "restart"
    => Could be a 4 player server/instance instead of MMO

Technical:
    - Authoritative Server/Client architecture
    - Each instance of the game has its own server/database, they are very separate

Game Design:
    - 2D? / 3D?
    - DnD 2e style spell system (spell slots)
    - No turn based combat
    - Random world events with big impact (eg. Horde of monsters invade settlement)
    - Day/Night system?
    - Faction/Clan sytem
    - Leveling up is a big deal, someone with higher level should have significant advantage

Ideas:
    - Dragon boss
    - Giant boss
    - Major cities, well defended
    - Small towns can be player owned
    - Different servers can be on different continents?
